/**
 * Execution Record — the forensic journal of ONE generation (CONTEXT.md "Execution Record",
 * PLAN.md decision 13 / WP-1.1).
 *
 * It explains WHAT was sent to the provider — the ordered controlled transforms (marker
 * expansion, macro/template passes, prompt-regex, depth/injection insertion, role merging,
 * trimming, provider shaping) plus the exact wire messages — but it does NOT change what is
 * sent. Production is additive and behavior-neutral: `assemblePrompt` returns a record
 * alongside its unchanged `sendMessages`, and the two callers may ignore it.
 *
 * This module is PURE DATA (+ the narrow journal interface `buildPrompt` receives). It lives in
 * `src/shared` so the renderer can read a persisted record later (issue 08 preview reader) without
 * crossing the main boundary — hence it must not import from `main`/`renderer`. The concrete
 * builder that hashes bulk spans and assembles the record lives main-side
 * (`src/main/services/generation/executionRecord.ts`).
 *
 * Forensic only: it explains a past assembly, it does NOT promise deterministic re-execution
 * (no captured RNG / state snapshots — deferred until something needs it, PLAN decision 13).
