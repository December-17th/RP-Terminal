# RP Terminal — Card SDK docs

The **SDK** is everything a character/world card can rely on when it runs in RP Terminal: the runtime API
it calls, the environment it renders in, the format it's stored as, and how an existing SillyTavern /
TavernHelper card is transformed into that format.

These docs are **load-bearing for card compatibility** — a card author (or the importer that transforms ST
cards) reads them as the contract. They must track the code.

## Contents

- **[component-inventory.md](component-inventory.md)** — the catalog: runtime API, rendering environment,
  authoring format, the ST→RPT transformation mapping, the PNG-cartridge direction, and the game-platform
  component targets. Start here.
- **[../rpt-api.md](../rpt-api.md)** — the method-level API reference (the detailed companion to the
  inventory's Layer A).
- **[../compat-comparison.md](../compat-comparison.md)** — RPT vs TavernHelper vs ST-Prompt-Template feature
  parity.
- **[../world-card-design.md](../world-card-design.md)** — the bundle format + one-click import + PNG
  cartridge plan (the "container" the inventory points to).
- **[../card-script-wcv-surfaces-design.md](../card-script-wcv-surfaces-design.md)** — design (not built):
  run full-page card scripts in a process-isolated WCV and let cards register their own panel/modal surfaces
  (the `创意工坊` case). Touches `thRuntime` + the format when implemented — update this contract then.

## Maintenance contract (read before changing card-facing code)

The SDK docs are **living**, not point-in-time. The single rule:

> **If you change the card-facing surface, update the SDK docs in the same change.**

The card-facing surface is:

| If you touch… | Update… |
| --- | --- |
| [`shared/thRuntime/`](../../src/shared/thRuntime/index.ts) (runtime API — both transports) | component-inventory §2 + rpt-api.md |
| [`cardBridge/`](../../src/renderer/src/cardBridge/) or [`preload/wcvPreload.ts`](../../src/preload/wcvPreload.ts) (transports) | component-inventory §2–3 |
| [`shared/cardEnv.ts`](../../src/shared/cardEnv.ts) / `cardLibs` (rendering env, injected libs) | component-inventory §3 |
| [`types/character.ts`](../../src/main/types/character.ts) (`RPTerminalExtSchema` — the format / bundle slots) | component-inventory §4 |
| the import / transform pipeline (`stPngParser`, `characterService`, the parsers) | component-inventory §5–6 |

Keep status markers honest (✅ built / 🟡 partial / 🔁 stub / ⬜ planned) and **cite the file each claim was
verified against** — per the repo's grounding rule (`CLAUDE.md`), never describe behavior from a name or
from memory. When two docs disagree, the one with file:line citations wins; reconcile the other to it.

Point-in-time docs (health checks, `docs/superpowers/specs|plans/*`, `progress-log.md`) are **snapshots** —
supersede them with a new dated file, don't silently rewrite them. The SDK docs are the opposite: edit in
place to stay current.
